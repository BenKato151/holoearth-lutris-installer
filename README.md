# Holoearth lutris installer
This lutris installer file is for Holoearth, which is developed by COVER corp and provides a platform for all 
Hololive fans. With this script, you can run Holoearth beta under linux using the wine manager lutris.


This lutris installer is the first one that I wrote, so please let me know any improvements. 


Here are some points that I still struggle with:

It just works out of the box on Wayland using any version after GE-Proton10.
I don't know why but anything else will not display the holoearth launcher under Wayland and I can't figure out why.
Because of that, please install any version greater than GE-Proton10 using ProtonUp-Qt!

Please let me know any improvements for that, thanks!
