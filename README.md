# Holoearth Beta lutris installer
This lutris installer file is for Holoearth beta, which is developed by COVER corp and provides a platform for all the 
Hololive fans. With this script, you can run Holoearth beta under linux using the wine manager lutris.


This lutris installer is the first one that I wrote, so please let me know any improvements. 


Here are some points that I still struggle with:
- A lot has changed since I've last visited Holoearth and with it's 1.0.0 release, the Holoearth devs improved a lot and I don't need to change anything at all anymore.

It just works out of the box on Wayland using UMU-Proton (Latest).
They also included an english version for the installer and it starts with english first.
So there is nothing to configure.
Have fun with Holoearth :D
