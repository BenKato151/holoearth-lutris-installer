# Holoearth Beta lutris installer
There are currently a few problems with this and I cannot get it fixed.
- Firefox
	- Firefox is needed since winebrowser will not open when you need to sign into Holoearth.
However, it crashes right after starting and I don't know what causes this or how to fix it.
I've tried with both an older version, aswell as the ESR and the latest one, but nothing worked.
- Fonts in the installer
	- Even with cjkfonts and fakejapanese, blank squares will show up during the installer process
